# Video Flashcards

This is the home of the additional resources for the Video Flashcards series on YouTube.

## General Philosophy

I created these videos at the request of a colleague as a way to quickly squeeze in some arithmetic practice for his classes. Although this is a timed practice, it's not a race. This isn't about going as fast as possible. Instead, it's about going through at a comfortable pace and giving the practice and repetition required to build up additional skill and confidence with basic arithmetic.

My intention is to build some short teaching videos for each type of flash card in order to elaborate a bit on the specific skills and ideas that each video is hoping to develop.
